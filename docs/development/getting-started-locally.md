# Deploying Registry Cache Extension Locally

## Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have a running local Gardener setup. The steps to complete this can be found in the [Deploying Gardener Locally guide](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/deployment/getting_started_locally.md).

## Setting up the Registry Cache Extension

Make sure that your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is targeting the local Gardener cluster. When this is ensured, run: 

```bash
make extension-up
```

The corresponding make target will build the extension image, load it into the kind cluster Nodes, and deploy the registry-cache ControllerDeployment and ControllerRegistration resources. The container image in the ControllerDeployment will be the image that was build and loaded into the kind cluster Nodes.

The make target will then deploy then registry-cache admission component. It will build the admission image, load it into the kind cluster Nodes, and finally install the admission component charts to the kind cluster.

## Creating a `Shoot` Cluster

Once the above step is completed you can create a Shoot cluster.

[`example/shoot-registry-cache.yaml`](../../example/shoot-registry-cache.yaml) contains a Shoot specification with the `registry-cache` extension:
```bash
kubectl create -f example/shoot-registry-cache.yaml
```

[`example/shoot-registry-mirror.yaml`](../../example/shoot-registry-mirror.yaml) contains a Shoot specification with the `registry-mirror` extension:
```bash
kubectl create -f example/shoot-registry-mirror.yaml
```

## Tearing Down the Dev Environment

To tear down the development environment delete the Shoot cluster or disable the `registry-cache` extension in the Shoot's specification. When the extension is not used by the Shoot anymore, you can run:

```bash
make extension-down
```

The make target will delete the ControllerDeployment and ControllerRegistration of the extension, and the registry-cache admission helm deployment.
